Okay.  First of all you can't view the "scpt" file (compiled applescrpt) via the github HTML server.

Yes, its important that I have the compiled scripts in the top-level of this working tree.  Other scripts load the "scpt" versions.  The text version is only for show; its not *real* source.

So, there is a "src" directory under each directory that contains the readable (and hopefully pygmented) source.
